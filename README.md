# Breast-Cancer-Detection
In this research effort, an extensive study was conducted on the prediction of breast cancer survival
 using five machine learning algorithms. The five algorithms employed in this study are Gradient
 Boosting, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, CatBoost and SVC. The key evaluation criteria for
 determining the performance of these algorithms are accuracy, precision, recall and F-1 score. Among
 these machine learning algorithms the Random Forest algorithm was consistent in terms of better
 performance compared to other algorithms. This algorithm achieved an accuracy of 0.9562, a precision
 of 0.9583, a recall of 0.9547 and a F-1 score of 0.9576 after application of oversampling and a 5-fold
 cross-validation. The application of hyperparameter tuning was able to improve most of the machine
 learning algorithms performance in the prediction task. At this stage, the Random Forest algorithm
 maintained its position as the highest performing algorithm. It achieved an accuracy of 0.9578, a
 precision of 0.9388, a recall of 0.9377 and a F-1 score of 0.9376. Although the hyperparameter tuning
 did not significantly improve the Random Forest algorithm’s performance but this step was able to
 improve other algorithms performance quite well. After the execution of hyperparameter tuning
 GBoosting and CatBoost algorithm’s performance improved quite well with quite close accuracy as
 the Random Forest but considering other evaluation metrics Random Forest stayed on top. Overall,
 this study was conducted with the goal of gaining valuable insights, which was finally accomplished.
